This is a short post, but really appreciate that JetBrains decided to give the [KMagick project](https://github.com/cherryleafroad/kmagick) a full All Products [Open Source license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/).

This will make developing a bit easier since I needed access to a debugger, which CLion can provide (also, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for the Kotlin portion). (I couldn't use VSCode since the Rust Analyzer plugin kicks up 90% CPU WAY too much)

JetBrains, you guys rock!
