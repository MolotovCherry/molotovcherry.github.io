## Projects
The main hobby projects I've been working on these days  
* [Android ImageMagick](https://github.com/cherryleafroad/Android-ImageMagick7) - A full port of ImageMagick to Android, binary + library, and features a bot that auto updates it every single release!
* [KMagick](https://github.com/cherryleafroad/kmagick) - Kotlin bindings to the ImageMagick API (also compatible with Android)
* [IntelliJ Rust Playground](https://github.com/cherryleafroad/IntelliJ-Rust-Playground) - An intellij plugin to crate a Rust local Rust playground, using scratch files. (much quicker than having to go to the official [playground site](https://play.rust-lang.org/))
