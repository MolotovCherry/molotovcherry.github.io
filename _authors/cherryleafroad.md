I'm a software engineer specializing in Rust\*, Python, C#, JavaScript, Android, Kotlin, and a bit of Unity game dev. My skillset includes making Android apps, systems programming with Rust\*, SQLite database (Android Room for example), game dev using Unity (and a bit of 3d modeling thrown in there), Qt (especially PyQt), JNI / Kotlin, HTML+CSS+Javascript.

\* I have an upper intermediate to advanced knowledge of Rust, including advanced things such as unsafe code, async (like Tokio), and even dynamic source code generation using procedural macros (syn).
